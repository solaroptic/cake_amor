Cake Amor Bakery Website
This website was created using React, JavaScript, animations in CSS, the Redux Toolkit system for state management, and RTK Query for data fetching. The focus of the project was on functionality and developing a large and fully functional website. The project was also used as an opportunity to use more complex and modern state management tools. The website will be used for an actual client, which is my first.
